Notifying the SEC and/or each State in which this notice is filed of the offering of securities described and
undertaking to furnish them, upon written request, in accordance with applicable law, the information furnished to offerees.*
Irrevocably appointing each of the Secretary of the SEC and the Securities Administrator or other legally designated officer of
the State in which the issuer maintains its principal place of business and any State in which this notice is filed, as its agents for service of
process, and agreeing that these persons may accept service on its behalf, of any notice, process or pleading, and further agreeing that
such service may be made by registered or certified mail, in any Federal or state action, administrative proceeding, or arbitration brought
against the issuer in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, if the action, proceeding or arbitration (a) arises out of any
activity in connection with the offering of securities that is the subject of this notice, and (b) is founded, directly or indirectly, upon the
provisions of: (i) the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or any rule or regulation under any of these statutes; or (ii) the laws of the

3. Related Persons l (continued)
FORM D U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, DC 20549
Instructions for Submitting a Form D Notice
General Instructions
Who must file: Each issuer of securities that sells
its securities in reliance on an exemption
provided in Regulation D or Section 4(a)(5) of
the Securities Act of 1933 must file this notice
containing the information requested with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
and with the state(s) requiring it. If more than
one issuer has sold its securities in the
same transaction, all issuers should be identified
in one filing with the SEC, but some states may
require a separate filing for each issuer or
security sold.
When to file:
o An issuer must file a new notice with the SEC
for each new offering of securities no later than
15 calendar days after the "date of first sale" of
securities in the offering as explained in the
Instruction to Item 7. For this purpose, the date of
first sale is the date on which the first investor is
irrevocably contractually committed to invest,
which, depending on the terms and conditions
of the contract, could be the date on which the
issuer receives the investor's subscription
agreement or check. An issuer may file the
notice at any time before that if it has
determined to make the offering. An issuer must
file a new notice with each state that requires it at
the time set by the state. For state filing
information, go to www.NASAA.org. A
mandatory capital commitment call does not
constitute a new offering, but is made under the
original offering, so no new Form D filing is
required.
o An issuer may file an amendment to a
previously filed notice at any time.
o An issuer must file an amendment to a
previously filed notice for an offering:
- to correct a material mistake of fact or
error in the previously filed notice, as soon
as practicable after discovery of the mistake
or error;
- to reflect a change in the information
provided in the previously filed notice,
except as provided below, as soon as
practicable after the change; and
- annually, on or before the first anniversary
of the most recent previously filed notice, if
the offering is continuing at that time.
When amendment is not required: An issuer
is not required to file an amendment to a
previously filed notice to reflect a change that
occurs after the offering terminates or a change
that occurs solely in the following information:
- the address or relationship to the issuer of
a related person identified in response to
Item 3;
- an issuer's revenues or aggregate net
asset value;
- the minimum investment amount, if the
change is an increase, or if the change,
together with all other changes in that
amount since the previously filed notice,
does not result in a decrease of more than
10%;
- any address or state(s) of solicitation
shown in response to Item 12;
- the total offering amount, if the change is
a decrease, or if the change, together with
all other changes in that amount since the
previously filed notice, does not result in an
increase of more than 10%;
- the amount of securities sold in the
offering or the amount remaining to be
sold;
- the number of non-accredited investors
who have invested in the offering, as long as
the change does not increase the number to
more than 35;
- the total number of investors who have
invested in the offering; and
- the amount of sales commissions, finders'
fees or use of proceeds for payments to
executive officers, directors or promoters, if
the change is a decrease, or if the change,
together with all other changes in that
amount since the previously filed notice,
does not result in an increase of more than
10%.
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays: If the date
on which a notice or an amendment to a
previously filed notice is required to be filed falls
on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the due date is
the first business day following.
Amendment content: An issuer that files an
amendment to a previously filed notice must
provide current information in response to all
items of this Form D, regardless of why the
amendment is filed.
How to file: Issuers must file this notice with
the SEC in electronic format. For state filing
information, go to www.NASAA.org.
Filing fee: There is no federal fiing fee. For
information on state filing fees, go to www.
NASAA.org.
Definitions of terms: Terms used but not
defined in this form that are defined in Rule 405
and Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933,
17 CFR 230.405 and 230.501, have the
meanings given to them in those rules.
Form D 5 





FORM D
Item-by-Item Instructions
Item 1. Issuer's Identity. Identify each legal entity issuing any securities being reported as being offered by entering its full name; any
previous name used within the past five years; and its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, type of legal entity, and year of
incorporation or organization within the past five years or status as formed over five years ago or not yet formed. If more than one entity is
issuing the securities, identify a primary issuer in the first fields shown on the first page of the form, checking the box provided, and identify
additional issuers by attaching Items 1 and 2 continuation page(s).
Item 2. Principal Place of Business and Contact Information. Enter a full street address of the issuer's principal place of business. Post
office box numbers and "In care of" addresses are not acceptable. Enter a contact telephone number for the issuer. If you identified more
than one issuer in response to Item 1, enter the requested information for the primary issuer you identified in response to that item and, at
your option, for any or all of the other issuers you identified on your Item 1 and 2 continuation page(s).
 Item 3. Related Persons. Enter the full name and address of each person having the specified relationships with any issuer and identify
each relationship:
• Each executive officer and director of the issuer and person performing similar functions (title alone is not determinative) for the
issuer, such as the general and managing partners of partnerships and managing members of limited liability companies; and
• Each person who has functioned directly or indirectly as a promoter of the issuer within the past five years of the later of the first sale
of securities or the date upon which the Form D filing was required to be made.
 If necessary to prevent the information supplied from being misleading, also provide a clarification in the space provided.
Identify additional persons having the specified relationships by checking the box provided and attaching Item 3 continuation page(s).
Item 4. Industry Group. Select the issuer's industry group. If the issuer or issuers can be categorized in more than one industry group,
select the industry group that most accurately reflects the use of the bulk of the proceeds of the offering. For purposes of this filing, use the
ordinary dictionary and commonly understood meanings of the terms identifying the industry group.
 Item 5. Issuer Size.
• Revenue Range (for issuers that do not specify "Hedge Fund" or "Other Investment Fund" in response to Item 4): Enter the revenue range
of the issuer or of all the issuers together for the most recently completed fiscal year available, or, if not in existence for a fiscal year, revenue
range to date. Domestic SEC reporting companies should state revenues in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Domestic non-reporting companies should state revenues in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP). Foreign issuers should calculate revenues in U.S. dollars and state them in accordance with U.S. GAAP, home country GAAP or
International Financial Reporting Standards. If the issuer(s) declines to disclose its revenue range, enter "Decline to Disclose." If the
issuer's(s') business is intended to produce revenue but did not, enter "No Revenues." If the business is not intended to produce revenue
(for example, the business seeks asset appreciation only), enter "Not Applicable."
• Aggregate Net Asset Value (for issuers that specify "Hedge Fund" or "Other Investment Fund" in response to Item 4): Enter the aggregate
net asset value range of the issuer or of all the issuers together as of the most recent practicable date. If the issuer(s) declines to disclose its
aggregate net asset value range, enter "Decline to Disclose."
 Item 6. Federal Exemption(s) and Exclusion(s) Claimed. Select the provision(s) being claimed to exempt the offering and resulting sales
from the federal registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and, if applicable, to exclude the issuer from the definition of
"investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Select "Rule 504(b)(1) (not (i), (ii) or (iii))" only if the issuer is relying on
the exemption in the introductory sentence of Rule 504 for offers and sales that satisfy all the terms and conditions of Rules 501 and 502(a),
(c) and (d).
Item 7. Type of Filing. Indicate whether the issuer is filing a new notice or an amendment to a notice that was filed previously. If this is a
new notice, enter the date of the first sale of securities in the offering or indicate that the first sale has "Yet to Occur." For this purpose, the
date of first sale is the date on which the first investor is irrevocably contractually committed to invest, which, depending on the terms and
conditions of the contract, could be the date on which the issuer receives the investor's subscription agreement or check.
Item 8. Duration of Offering. Indicate whether the issuer intends the offering to last for more than one year.
Form D 6 

FORM D
Item-by-Item Instructions (Continued)
Item 9. Type(s) of Securities Offered. Select the appropriate type or types of securities offered as to which this notice is filed. If the
securities are debt convertible into other securities, however, select "Debt" and any other appropriate types of securities except for "Equity."
For purposes of this filing, use the ordinary dictionary and commonly understood meanings of these categories. For instance, equity
securities would be securities that represent proportional ownership in an issuer, such as ordinary common and preferred stock of
corporations and partnership and limited liability company interests; debt securities would be securities representing money loaned to an
issuer that must be repaid to the investor at a later date; pooled investment fund interests would be securities that represent ownership
interests in a pooled or collective investment vehicle; tenant-in-common securities would be securities that include an undivided fractional
interest in real property other than a mineral property; and mineral property securities would be securities that include an undivided
interest in an oil, gas or other mineral property.
Item 10. Business Combination Transaction. Indicate whether or not the offering is being made in connection with a business
combination, such as an exchange (tender) offer or a merger, acquisition, or other transaction of the type described in paragraph (a)(1), (2)
or (3) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933. Do not include an exchange (tender) offer for a class of the issuer's own securities. If
necessary to prevent the information supplied from being misleading, also provide a clarification in the space provided.
Item 11. Minimum Investment. Enter the minimum dollar amount of investment that will be accepted from any outside investor. If the
offering provides a minimum investment amount for outside investors that can be waived, provide the lowest amount below which a
waiver will not be granted. If there is no minimum investment amount, enter "0." Investors will be considered outside investors if they are
not employees, officers, directors, general partners, trustees (where the issuer is a business trust), consultants, advisors or vendors of the
issuer, its parents, its majority owned subsidiaries, or majority owned subsidiaries of the issuer's parent.
Item 12. Sales Compensation. Enter the requested information for each person that has been or will be paid directly or indirectly any
commission or other similar compensation in cash or other consideration in connection with sales of securities in the offering, including
finders. Enter the CRD number for every person identified and any broker and dealer listed that has a CRD number. CRD numbers can be
found at http://brokercheck.finra.org. A person that does not have a CRD number need not obtain one in order to be listed, and must be
listed when required regardless of whether the person has a CRD number. In addition, check the State(s) in which the named person has
solicited or intends to solicit investors. If more than five persons to be listed are associated persons of the same broker or dealer, enter only
the name of the broker or dealer, its CRD number and street address, and the State(s) in which the named person has solicited or intends to
solicit investors.
Item 13. Offering and Sales Amounts. Enter the dollar amount of securities being offered under a claim of federal exemption identified in
Item 6 above. Also enter the dollar amount of securities sold in the offering as of the filing date. Select the "Indefinite" box if the amount
being offered is undetermined or cannot be calculated at the present time, such as if the offering includes securities to be acquired upon
the exercise or exchange of other securities or property and the exercise price or exchange value is not currently known or knowable. If an
amount is definite but difficult to calculate without unreasonable effort or expense, provide a good faith estimate. The total offering and
sold amounts should include all cash and other consideration to be received for the securities, including cash to be paid in the future under
mandatory capital commitments. In offerings for consideration other than cash, the amounts entered should be based on the issuer's good
faith valuation of the consideration. If necessary to prevent the information supplied from being misleading, also provide a clarification in
the space provided.
Item 14. Investors. Indicate whether securities in the offering have been or may be sold to persons who do not qualify as accredited
investors as defined in Rule 501(a), 17 CFR 230.501(a), and provide the number of such investors who have already invested in the
offering. In addition, regardless of whether securities in the offering have been or may be sold to persons who do not qualify as accredited
investors, specify the total number of investors who already have invested.
Item 15. Sales Commission and Finders' Fees Expenses. The information on sales commissions and finders' fees expenses may be given
as subject to future contingencies.
Item 16. Use of Proceeds. No additional instructions.
Signature and Submission. An individual who is a duly authorized representative of each issuer identified must sign, date and submit this
notice for the issuer. The capacity in which the individual is signing should be set forth in the "Title" field underneath the individual's name.
The name of the issuer(s) on whose behalf the notice is being submitted should be set forth in the "Issuer" field beside the individual's
name; if the individual is signing on behalf of all issuers submitting the notice, the word "All" may be set forth in the "Issuer" field. Attach
signature continuation page(s) to have different individuals sign on behalf of different issuer(s). Enter the number of continuation pages
attached and included in the filing. If no continuation pages are attached, enter "0".

These PNC Bank Acquirer Terms (“Member Bank Terms”) are additional terms applicable to the Stripe Payments Services for Visa and Mastercard products for which PNC Bank, N.A. (“Member Bank”) is a Payment Method Acquirer (“VM Payment Processing Services”). In these Member Bank Terms, Visa and Mastercard may be referred to individually as a “Network” and collectively as the “Networks”, and the rules issued by a Network are the “Network Rules.” Additionally, for purposes of these Member Bank Terms, if you are registered with a Network pursuant to applicable Network Rules, you are considered “Network Registered.” Any terms used but not defined in these Member Bank Terms will have the meaning provided in the Stripe Services Agreement (“Agreement”).

These Member Bank Terms constitute a legal agreement among you, Stripe, and Member Bank, a national bank, with offices at 300 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222. The legal agreement is formed by Member Bank’s and Stripe’s offer of these Member Bank Terms to you, your acceptance of these Member Bank Terms, and Member Bank’s and Stripe’s subsequent provision of VM Payment Processing Services to you.

These Member Bank Terms are offered to you, and the legal agreement established by these Member Bank Terms becomes effective as provided below.

For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.

You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Member Bank Terms to use the VM Payment Processing Services. If you do not accept them, you may not receive VM Payment Processing Services.

Network Compliance and Disclosure Important Member Bank Disclosures: Member Bank discloses that (i) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and Mastercard products directly to you under these Member Bank Terms; (ii) it must be a principal party to these Member Bank Terms; (iii) it is responsible for educating you on the Network Rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; and (iv) subject to Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, it is responsible for and must provide the Settlement Funds (as defined below) that it receives to Stripe (or Stripe’s designated financial services provider) for Stripe’s distribution to you; and (v) with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, Stripe is responsible for all funds that may be held in reserve that are derived from your Settlement Funds.
Your Responsibilities: In addition to any other responsibilities set forth in these Member Bank Terms, you agree that, at all times throughout the term of these Member Bank Terms, you will (i) comply with the PCI Standards in using and maintaining Payment Account Details; (ii) maintain fraud and Dispute rates acceptable under the Network Rules; (iii) review and understand the terms of these Member Bank Terms; (iv) comply with the Network Rules and Laws; and (v) comply with the Agreement.

Stripe is registered as a Payment Facilitator and an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) by Member Bank. You may contact Member Bank by writing to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.

Purpose of these Member Bank Terms When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.
As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.

Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:
i. Only submit Transactions authorized by the cardholder;

ii. Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated in your Stripe Account and not for any products, services, or donations (i) prohibited by Laws or Network Rules, or (ii) that qualify as Restricted Businesses, unless you have received prior written approval from Stripe;

iii. Submit a Transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the Transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the Transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);

iv. Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition charges for use of VM Payment Cards, and not discourage the use of one VM Payment Card brand over another;

v. Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted charge;

vi. Not submit a Transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check;

vii. Only use the Network logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;

viii. Prohibit use of Payment Cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);

ix. Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with the PCI Standards and only use cardholder data as permitted, and certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of VM Payment Cards or cardholder data;

x. Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the Transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;

xi. Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with Customers, including those resulting in a Dispute, and not attempt to recharge a Customer for a Transaction that was previously Disputed and subsequently returned to you unless the recharge is expressly authorized by the Customer; and

xii. Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.

Authorization for Settlement and Disbursement of Funds When Member Bank receives funds from the Networks for settlement of your Card Payments (“Settlement Funds”), Member Bank will provide the Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, which will accept the Settlement Funds on your behalf. You agree to designate Stripe and Stripe Payments Company as your agent for purposes of receiving Settlement Funds, and you authorize Stripe to instruct Member Bank on your behalf on how and when to make transfers of Settlement Funds to Stripe, including the initiation of holds, receipts, and disbursements of Settlement Funds. Settlement Funds will be held by Stripe in pooled merchant funds accounts pending disbursement to you (or any applicable third-party recipient you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement to on your behalf) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms.
You agree you are not entitled to access the Settlement Funds prior to the Settlement Funds being credited by Stripe to your User Bank Account (or the bank account of a third-party recipient to which you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement on your behalf). You further agree that you have no right to direct Member Bank to distribute Settlement Funds, that you may not assign any interest in any Settlement Funds held by Member Bank, and that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the Settlement Funds held by Member Bank. Any authorizations set forth in these Member Bank Terms will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.

You agree that Member Bank’s transfer of Settlement Funds to your designated agents, Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, satisfies Member Bank’s settlement obligation to you, and that, after Member Bank transfers Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, any dispute or claim you may have regarding the receipt or amount of Settlement Funds will be between you and Stripe or Stripe Payments Company. Further, if a cardholder disputes a Transaction, if a Transaction is Disputed for any reason, or if Member Bank reasonably believes a Transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such Transaction may be Disputed and debited from Settlement Funds held by Member Bank.

Sharing of Data a. You authorize Stripe and Member Bank to provide Protected Data to each other to (i) provide the VM Payment Processing Services, (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you provided to Stripe before these Member Bank Terms became effective and information about Member Bank and Stripe’s experience with you, such as termination of these Member Bank Terms by Member Bank and the reasons for such termination. Where required to comply with our obligations under Laws, the Network Rules, or any of Member Bank’s regulatory obligations, Member Bank may provide any data to law enforcement, the Networks, or other government regulators.
b. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires each financial institution to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes a customer relationship with the financial institution. To comply with this requirement, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide to Member Bank any information required to verify your identity, including your name, address, and taxpayer identification number. If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.

Term and Termination These Member Bank Termsbecome effective as provided in the introductory paragraphs and shall continue in effect so long as you use the VM Payment Processing Services.These Member Bank Terms will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination. In addition, the VM Payment Processing Services and/or these Member Bank Terms may be terminated by Member Bank, Stripe, or either Network as provided in the introductory paragraphs.

Representations and Warranties In addition to the representations and warranties made in the Agreement, which are incorporated by reference to this Addendum in their entirety, you represent and warrant to Member Bank and Stripe as of each day on which you receive VM Payment Processing Services that:

a. You are legally able to enter into these Member Bank Terms;

b. You will not use the VM Payment Processing Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking; and

c. You will only use the VM Payment Processing Services in a manner consistent with the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms, the Documentation, and Network Rules.

Indemnification Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Member Bank, and its respective employees, directors, agents, subcontractors and affiliates (collectively the “Member Bank Entities”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage (including indirect or consequential damage), action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of any provision of the Agreement or these Member Bank Terms; (b) your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (c) your obligations to pay fees or fines to Stripe, your Customers, Payment Method Providers, or third parties; (d) your negligence or willful misconduct or the negligence or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents; and (e) all third-party indemnity obligations Member Bank incurs as a direct or indirect result of your acts or omissions (including indemnification of any Network, card issuer, or intermediary bank).

Disclaimer of Warranties THE SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THESE MEMBER BANK TERMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, QUALITY, SUITABILTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES AS THEY DO TO STRIPE. THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES (A) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR STRIPE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND (B) DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY YOU, STRIPE, OR ANY THIRD PARTY.

Limitations on Liability In no event will the Member Bank Entities be liable for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement, these Member Bank Terms, or the VM Payment Processing Services described in either, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of services provided by Stripe. Under no circumstances will any of the Member Bank Entities be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access, or use of the VM Payment Processing Services, your Stripe Account, or Protected Data, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate for your business.

The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.

Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.

The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.

United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the VM Payment Processing Services are solely for use by you in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Member Bank Terms, Member Bank may decline to process any Transaction submitted by you in its sole discretion.

Dispute Resolution All disputes under these Member Bank Terms are subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement. In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.

Waiver The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.

Miscellaneous These Member Bank Terms are entered into, governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law provisions. These Member Bank Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of Member Bank and Stripe. These Member Bank Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees, and assignees. If any provision of these Member Bank Terms are determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and these Member Bank Terms will be construed as if such provision is not contained in these Member Bank Terms.

For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.

You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Member Bank Terms to use the VM Payment Processing Services. If you do not accept them, you may not receive VM Payment Processing Services.

Network Compliance and Disclosure Important Member Bank Disclosures: Member Bank discloses that (i) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and Mastercard products directly to you under these Member Bank Terms; (ii) it must be a principal party to these Member Bank Terms; (iii) it is responsible for educating you on the Network Rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; and (iv) subject to Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, it is responsible for and must provide the Settlement Funds (as defined below) that it receives to Stripe (or Stripe’s designated financial services provider) for Stripe’s distribution to you; and (v) with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, Stripe is responsible for all funds that may be held in reserve that are derived from your Settlement Funds.
Your Responsibilities: In addition to any other responsibilities set forth in these Member Bank Terms, you agree that, at all times throughout the term of these Member Bank Terms, you will (i) comply with the PCI Standards in using and maintaining Payment Account Details; (ii) maintain fraud and Dispute rates acceptable under the Network Rules; (iii) review and understand the terms of these Member Bank Terms; (iv) comply with the Network Rules and Laws; and (v) comply with the Agreement.

Stripe is registered as a Payment Facilitator and an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) by Member Bank. You may contact Member Bank by writing to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.

Purpose of these Member Bank Terms When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.
As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.

Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:
i. Only submit Transactions authorized by the cardholder;

ii. Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated in your Stripe Account and not for any products, services, or donations (i) prohibited by Laws or Network Rules, or (ii) that qualify as Restricted Businesses, unless you have received prior written approval from Stripe;

iii. Submit a Transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the Transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the Transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);

iv. Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition charges for use of VM Payment Cards, and not discourage the use of one VM Payment Card brand over another;

v. Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted charge;

vi. Not submit a Transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check;

vii. Only use the Network logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;

viii. Prohibit use of Payment Cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);

ix. Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with the PCI Standards and only use cardholder data as permitted, and certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of VM Payment Cards or cardholder data;

x. Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the Transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;

xi. Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with Customers, including those resulting in a Dispute, and not attempt to recharge a Customer for a Transaction that was previously Disputed and subsequently returned to you unless the recharge is expressly authorized by the Customer; and

xii. Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.

Authorization for Settlement and Disbursement of Funds When Member Bank receives funds from the Networks for settlement of your Card Payments (“Settlement Funds”), Member Bank will provide the Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, which will accept the Settlement Funds on your behalf. You agree to designate Stripe and Stripe Payments Company as your agent for purposes of receiving Settlement Funds, and you authorize Stripe to instruct Member Bank on your behalf on how and when to make transfers of Settlement Funds to Stripe, including the initiation of holds, receipts, and disbursements of Settlement Funds. Settlement Funds will be held by Stripe in pooled merchant funds accounts pending disbursement to you (or any applicable third-party recipient you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement to on your behalf) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms.
You agree you are not entitled to access the Settlement Funds prior to the Settlement Funds being credited by Stripe to your User Bank Account (or the bank account of a third-party recipient to which you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement on your behalf). You further agree that you have no right to direct Member Bank to distribute Settlement Funds, that you may not assign any interest in any Settlement Funds held by Member Bank, and that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the Settlement Funds held by Member Bank. Any authorizations set forth in these Member Bank Terms will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.

You agree that Member Bank’s transfer of Settlement Funds to your designated agents, Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, satisfies Member Bank’s settlement obligation to you, and that, after Member Bank transfers Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, any dispute or claim you may have regarding the receipt or amount of Settlement Funds will be between you and Stripe or Stripe Payments Company. Further, if a cardholder disputes a Transaction, if a Transaction is Disputed for any reason, or if Member Bank reasonably believes a Transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such Transaction may be Disputed and debited from Settlement Funds held by Member Bank.

Sharing of Data a. You authorize Stripe and Member Bank to provide Protected Data to each other to (i) provide the VM Payment Processing Services, (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you provided to Stripe before these Member Bank Terms became effective and information about Member Bank and Stripe’s experience with you, such as termination of these Member Bank Terms by Member Bank and the reasons for such termination. Where required to comply with our obligations under Laws, the Network Rules, or any of Member Bank’s regulatory obligations, Member Bank may provide any data to law enforcement, the Networks, or other government regulators.
b. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires each financial institution to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes a customer relationship with the financial institution. To comply with this requirement, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide to Member Bank any information required to verify your identity, including your name, address, and taxpayer identification number. If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.

Term and Termination These Member Bank Termsbecome effective as provided in the introductory paragraphs and shall continue in effect so long as you use the VM Payment Processing Services.These Member Bank Terms will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination. In addition, the VM Payment Processing Services and/or these Member Bank Terms may be terminated by Member Bank, Stripe, or either Network as provided in the introductory paragraphs.

Representations and Warranties In addition to the representations and warranties made in the Agreement, which are incorporated by reference to this Addendum in their entirety, you represent and warrant to Member Bank and Stripe as of each day on which you receive VM Payment Processing Services that:

a. You are legally able to enter into these Member Bank Terms;

b. You will not use the VM Payment Processing Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking; and

c. You will only use the VM Payment Processing Services in a manner consistent with the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms, the Documentation, and Network Rules.

Disclaimer of Warranties THE SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THESE MEMBER BANK TERMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, QUALITY, SUITABILTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES AS THEY DO TO STRIPE. THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES (A) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR STRIPE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND (B) DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY YOU, STRIPE, OR ANY THIRD PARTY.

Limitations on Liability In no event will the Member Bank Entities be liable for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement, these Member Bank Terms, or the VM Payment Processing Services described in either, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of services provided by Stripe. Under no circumstances will any of the Member Bank Entities be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access, or use of the VM Payment Processing Services, your Stripe Account, or Protected Data, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate for your business.

The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.

Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.

The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.

United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC.

In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.

Waiver The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.
